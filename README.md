# tax-anomalies-prediction-model
a ml model to predict discrepancies in tax paid by a certain amount of people
since it is real hard to get real dataset with real world data , i hd to create my own data sets so the model is having issues with being overfitted but to my underdstanding if i have real data the model would work with a >65 % accuracy
